# CodeSpaces-Sabatage

This repo is for code related to sabataging the local dev demo portion of my belfastJS talk. By binding processes to ports, ruining local envs, and messing with dependencies I will demonstrate that local dev environments are very fragile. 

## Setup

### 1. Bind port 
```bash
cd bind-port
sls offline
```
